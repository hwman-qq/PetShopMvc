        <blockquote>
            The Microsoft .NET Pet Shop Blueprint Application is an online pet
            store. Like most e-stores, you can browse and search the product catalog,
            choose items to add to your shopping cart, amend your shopping cart, and order
            the items in the shopping cart. You can perform many of these actions without
            registering with or logging into the application. However, before you can order
            items you must log in (sign in) to the application. In order to sign in, you
            must have an account with the application, which is created when you register
            (sign up) with the application.<p>

            This section describes how to browse and search the product catalog.<p>
                <a name="Browsing"></a><b>Browsing the Catalog</b><br>
                The pet store catalog is organized hierarchically as follows: categories,
                products, and items.
            <p>
                You list the products in a category by clicking the category name or one of the
                pictures on the home page, or by clicking the category name on the top banner
                of other pages.
            <p>
                The Pet Shop will display a list of products within the selected category.
                Clicking a product displays a list of items and their prices. Clicking an item
                displays a text and visual description of the item and the number of that item
                in stock.
            <p>
                <a name="Searching"></a><b>Searching the Catalog</b><br>
                You search for products by typing keywords in the search field on the top
                banner.
            </p>

        <span class="title">Working with the Shopping Cart</span>
        <blockquote>
            <a name="Adding"></a><b>Adding and Removing Items</b><br>
            You add an item to your shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button next
            to the item. This action also displays your shopping cart.<p>
                You remove an item from your shopping cart by clicking the "Remove" button next
                to the item.
            <p>
                To continue shopping, select a category from the list on the top banner.
            <p>
                <a name="Updating"></a><b>Updating the Quantity of an Item</b><br>
                You adjust the quantity of an item by typing the quantity in the item's
                "Quantity" field in the shopping cart and clicking the "Update" button.
            <p>
                If the quantity of items requested is greater than that in stock, the "In
                Stock" field in the shopping cart will show that the item is back ordered.
            <p>
                <a name="Ordering"></a><b>Ordering Items</b><br>
                You order the items in the shopping cart by clicking the "Proceed to Checkout"
                button. The Pet Shop will display a read-only list of your shopping cart
                contents. To proceed with checkout, click the "Continue" button.
            <p>
                If you have not signed in, the application will display the sign in page, where
                you will need to provide your user ID and password. Otherwise, the application
                will display a page requesting order information. When you have filled in the
                required information, click the "Continue" button and the application will
                display a read-only page verifying your billing and shipping address. If you
                need to change any information, click your browser's "Back" button and enter
                the correct information. To complete the order, click the "Continue" button.
